The same path used to be followed by every programmer, who begin to learn about new technologies and shape the surrounding reality with them. The pursuit of further tasks convinced us that there would always be problems to solve. Who knows, maybe one of the projects will soon be one of yours?",
				"paragraph2": "The dynak.com was founded by siblings Emilia and Cesare Dynak on the 20th of March in 2019. The International Day of happiness became a reason for this. And our goal from the beginning was for customers and employees to enjoy working with us. This joy gives it a special meaning and pursue real worthwhile projects.",
				"paragraph3": "Turquoise is not only a color theme of the website, but also a symbol of values that are important for us. We do not base our work on a rigid hierarchy, but on responsibility and mutual trust. These are the characteristics of so-called “Turquoise organizations.” All processes and documents within the company are public. We approach boldly non-standard solutions if we know they will improve someone's life. This approach is compatible with Agile project management."

Due to these needs the dynak.io app was born, which integrates building automation systems. The most trivial functions can be valued at increadible amounts. Sometimes they just don't exist. Here, however, just one module to add may be enough.",
			"text2": "Warehouse is an app that streamlines processes repeated in warehouses hundreds of times a day - such as accepting or dispensing goods. The user interface is designed for convenience and readability. Because it works as a website, it can be run on virtually any device with a web browser. Additionally, it interacts with external user authorization, sticker printer, and downloads and writes data to the ERP system.",
			"text3": "We approach even relatively easy projects such as creating a website with full commitment. Social media is not enough. Only a proper website will support your business. We will implement the project according to your vision and allow you to stand out from the competition. Whether you need a simple website or something really customized - you can achieve it with us!",
